## Particle system \(DX7\)


</div>

### Description

This demonstrates the use of D3D to render particles, there are 3 different particle systems, but all with very similar interfaces, and it only takes 3 or 4 lines of code to use these classes.

The different particle systems that I've demonstrated are snow, fire and smoke, although they can easily be changed, or more added with little effort.

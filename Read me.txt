This is a simple program that uses my D3D for 2D module to render
3 different types of particle systems onto a 2D screen.

The 3 particle systems are:-
  Fire
  Snow
  Smoke

There are many improvements that you could make, but I just
knocked this code up in an hour because I don't have access to
VC++ at the moment, and I really wanted to do some particle
system coding.

This code could be used in a 3D environment, all your have to
do is add a Z componant to the clsParticle Class.

Have a look at it anyway, and if you like it then use it in
something, or modify to suit your own needs, all I ask is that
you E-mail me a copy (or demo) of the project that you use this
in.


Thanks
